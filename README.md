# Automatic Facebook Login With Python ![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)

 This is a Python script to automate the login process on Facebook.com. It uses Python 3.x and  Selenium library to automate the process.


It uses a python module named "Selenium" and "Chrome Webdriver_Manager". Make sure you have Selenium and Webdriver_Manager installed and run this file using terminal because getpass may not work on other GUIs.

If you use a Google Account or Gmail you have to allow Less Secure apps to login in Your Google Account From https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps. Otherwise this will not run accordingly.
